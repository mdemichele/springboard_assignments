# Part One: Solidify Terminology
In your own terms, define the following terms:

- What is HTTP?
HTTP is the protocol developed in the early 1990s that is the primary means of sharing resources across the Web. HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. Understanding how HTTP works is a key component of understanding how modern web development works, since most of the interesting things you can do on the web involve some kind of transfer of information between two or more parties, usually through HTTP.

- What is a URL?
A URL is essentially the address of a resource on the web. URL simple stands for Uniform Resource Locator. URLs are used to look up different websites and resources on the web.

- What is DNS?
A DNS, or Domain Name System, is a directory of human-readable addresses or locations on the web that match with the corresponding IP address 

- What is a query string?
A query string is a piece of extra information provided to a url that defines search terms and other arguments used in an HTTP request  

- What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
Two of the fundamental HTTP methods are GET and POST. The two represent distinct actions within the CRUD operation set. GET retrieves/reads information from a server. POST creates/posts information to a server.

- What is an HTTP request?
An HTTP request is a request made from a client to a server. A request will comprise of a specific CRUd method (i.e GET, POST, PUT, etc.) and will expect a response back from the server 

- What is an HTTP Response?
An HTTP response is a response from a server back to the client.

- What is an HTTP header?
An HTTP header specifies information about the particular request or response. 

- What are the processes that happen when you type "http://somesite.com/some/page.html‚Äù into a browser? 
When you type a url into a browser, the browser then looks that url up in a DNS server. The DNS server matches that url with an IP address. The browser than makes the requisite request to the IP Address. The IP address receives the request and serves back up a response, which is displayed in the browser for the user.
